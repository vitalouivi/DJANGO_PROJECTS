          <p>In 2022, I graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute, received my bachelor degree in applied mathematics and information technology.</p>
          <p>During the 4 years of study, I gained a lot of experience in learning various programming languages and mathematical tools.</p>
          <p>In Python, I had to write a backend using the Django framework, also I implemented neural networks using various libraries (NumPy, Keras, SkLearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow).</p>
          <p>In C++, I mastered the basics of OOP, worked with streams, studied and implemented sorting algorithms and data structures.</p>
          <p>I also did GPU calculations using CUDA technologies for image processing.</p>
          <p>Also, during the process of learning, I mastered some additional programming languages(Lisp, Prolog, R).</p>
          <p>Among the subjects at university I studied a SQL course, where I was taught how to create relational databases, complex queries for them.</p>
          <p>Among other things, I gained knowledge in mathematical analysis, probability theory, mathematical statistics and many other mathematical subjects.</p>
          <p>A large number of subjects required colossal volumes of reporting activities in various  forms with different requirements. Due to this, I learned how to competently draw up reports in accordance with customer requirements and meeting their specific needs.</p>
          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">School No. 1533</p>
          <p>At the lyceum, during programming lessons, I gained skills in writing window applications in C#, the knowledge of which I further expanded with the help of online courses and working with documentation on my own.</p>
          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">CLAC</p>
          <p>In addition to school lessons and an English language course at the lyceum and university, I attended a summer school in the UK, where I received practical skills and in-depth theoretical knowledge, which greatly contributed to my practical use of English in oral and written form in correspondence, the study of original unadapted sources during writing a diploma thesis in my specialty.</p>         </div>
